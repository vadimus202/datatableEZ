Description: This is a wrapper around \code{DT::datatable()} with more convenient
    defaults. Also, most common elements of \code{options()} argument are moved
    to direct arguments list for this function. This removes to necessity to pass
    on long options list (which is not well documented in the DT package
    documentation). It also makes them avalable for auto-complete in RStudio.
